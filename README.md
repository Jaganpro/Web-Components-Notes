# Web-Components-Notes

### What are web components?
* When we build web components, there are 3 fundamental building blocks. (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
* Web components brings all these 3 technologies together to build truly encapsulated components for the web.
* Some of the popular web components frameworks are 
  * Polymer
  * SkateJS
  * x-tag
* These components not only built on top of web-components, they also provide additional capabilities. For example, Polymer provides data-binding capabilities.
* But using 3rd party libraries, we will lose interoperability and portability.
